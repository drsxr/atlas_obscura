## Does the world really need a third DRSXR blog?

     I'm writing this morning (well, really early afternoon but it feels like morning to me)
     testing out my friend Jeremy Howard's fast.ai blogging widget he cobbled together to use
     with github, and seeing how it works.
     
     Here's what's on my mind today: My kids, #coronavirus, the fact that people seem to like 
     my new blogposts on my other websites - www.ai-imaging.org and www.n2value.com/blog , 
     and the culture wars we are living through.  I don't particularly want to be a member 
     of either the #insurgency or the #resistance; I'd much rather be on team 'C' - but there isn't one.
